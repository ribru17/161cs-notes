## Reasoning

- Deduction:
  - What is implied by what we know?
- Belief Revision:
  - What beliefs to give up in case of a contradiction?
- Causality:
  - What is the cause of an event?

## NLP (Processing vs. Understanding)

- Syntactic Ambiguity:
  - "They are cooking apples" (The apples are for cooking or "they" are cooking
    them?)
- Semantic Ambiguity:
  - "She ran to the bank" (River bank or monetary bank?)
- Pragmatic ambiguity:
  - "Can you open the door?" (Is this a question or a request?)
